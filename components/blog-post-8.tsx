      <h2>The Personal Creative Revolution</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Every creative professional has a unique vision—a distinct aesthetic, a particular approach to visual storytelling, a specific way of interpreting the world. Eurus Studio's custom training capabilities transform this personal vision from an abstract concept into a tangible, reproducible creative asset. This isn't just about teaching software; it's about creating a digital extension of your creative consciousness.</p>
      <h3>The Philosophy of Personal AI Training</h3>
      <h4>Creative DNA Capture</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">Custom training in Eurus Studio operates on the principle of creative DNA capture—identifying and encoding the unique elements that define your creative style. This goes beyond simple pattern recognition to understand the underlying creative principles, aesthetic choices, and artistic philosophies that drive your work.</p>
      <h4>Artistic Fingerprint Development</h4>
      <p className="mb-4">Every artist has an artistic fingerprint—a unique combination of color preferences, composition choices, subject matter approaches, and stylistic elements that make their work recognizable. Custom training captures this fingerprint and enables its application across new creative projects.</p>
